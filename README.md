# recommend_me

My first recommendation systems. Made using sklearn, pandas and numpy. The data is taken from the Kaggle website.

# Movie Recommendation System
The system for recommending movies is based on correlation. I use Pearson's correlation. Correlation Based Recommenders are a simpler form of collaborative filtering based recommenders. They give you more flavor of being personalized as they would recommend the item that is most similar to the item selected before.

# Anime Recommendation System
This type of recommendation system uses an anime description to recommend the next most similar one. Content-based recommendations also provide "personalized" recommendations. The main difference between correlation-based recommendations and content-based recommendations is that the first system takes into account "user behavior" and then considers the content for recommendation. Content-based recommendations uses keywords in the description to find similarities between anime.
